Sample selection:

Path format: /Samples/chord/selection.wav

Where "chord" is the symbol output from the chord object, eg. "A minor 7th", and "selection" is the pressed key, eg. "G" or "Strum Up".

Behaviour:

Pressing G, C, E, A, Strum Up, or Strum Down sends the selection and the current chord to a fixed voice for each selection, which plays back the sample at the path comprised by the chord and selection.
Pressing Mute switches off all voices and plays Mute.wav independently.
Pressing a percussion selection plays the appropriate percussion sample.
