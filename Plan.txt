TODO:

* Create JSON data structure mapping chords to notes.
* Create script to create directory structure and symlinks.
* Configure voices to play note and chord samples.
* Add mute method.
* Add percussion voices.
* Sample chord strums.
* Sample percussion.


Plan 1:

File structure:

Samples/
    Strings/
        4/
            4-G.wav
            4-Ab.wav
            4-A.wav
            ...
        3/
            3-C.wav
            ...
        2/
            2-E.wav
            ...
        1/
            1-A.wav
            ...
    Chords/
        A unison/
            4.wav -> symlink to appropriate single note on G string in Strings.
            3.wav -> symlink to appropriate single note on C string in Strings.
            2.wav -> symlink to appropriate single note on E string in Strings.
            1.wav -> symlink to appropriate single note on A string in Strings.
            Strum Up.wav
            Strum Down.wav
        A major/
            4.wav
            3.wav
            ...
    ...


Sample selection:

Path format: /Samples/chord/selection.wav

Where "chord" is the symbol output from the chord object, eg. "A minor 7th", and "selection" is the pressed key, eg. "G" or "Strum Up".

Behaviour:

Pressing G, C, E, A, Strum Up, or Strum Down sends the selection and the current chord to a fixed voice for each selection, which plays back the sample at the path comprised by the chord and selection.
Pressing Mute switches off all voices and plays Mute.wav independently.
Pressing a percussion selection plays the appropriate percussion sample.


Plan 2:

File Structure:

Samples/
    Strings/
        4/
            4-G.wav
            4-Ab.wav
            4-A.wav
            ...
        3/
            3-C.wav
            ...
        2/
            2-E.wav
            ...
        1/
            1-A.wav
            ...
Chords/
    A unison.txt
    A major.txt
    ...


Chord file format:

Line 1: String 1 note.
Line 2: String 2 note.
Line 3: String 3 note.
Line 4: String 4 note.

Example: A minor 7th.txt

A4
E4
C4
G4
